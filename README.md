# MATLAB Scripts

CNN_Image_Filter and digit_identifier_RNN are MATLAB scripts I wrote that involve basic machine learning with a convolutional or recurrent neural network.

CNN_Image_Filter: Create and apply image filters with a convolutional neural netowrk. Example with UC Irvine's mascot. 

digit_identifier_RNN: Train a recurrent neural network (RNN) to identify handwritten digits via a webcam
